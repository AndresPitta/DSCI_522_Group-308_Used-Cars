# Proposal 

In this project, we will be conducting an analysis on the "Used Cars Dataset" from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data). 
We will develop a model to answer the predictive question: What features are most important in predicting the market
price of a used car? A subquestion can be predicting the price of a car based on features.

We will perform and exploratory data analysis to get an overview of basic summary statistics, if there exists any outliers or 
eroneous data points, determining correlations between variables, if there exists multicollinearity in the data, and 
identifying which features we think will be most important. 

We will be splitting the data to appropriate training, validation, and test sets in order to prevent biassing the results 
before conducting any analysis. The full dataset is roughly 1.4 GB in size so we will be taking a sample to improve the time 
and efficiency of our initial stages of the model building.
